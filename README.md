# `nvimsence.rs`

A NeoVim plugin for generating Discord Rich Presences, and written in Rust.

Notes:
* `nvimsence.rs` is currently a WIP project
* Installation currently requires compilation after downloading. A future goal is to distribute pre-compiled binaries to simplify the installation process
* The plugin currently lacks configuration options, which is a something that will ideally be improved upon in the future
